# HIP-RDF-Tutorials

ROOT RDataFrame tutorials aimed for people new to RDataFrame and in the context of CMS jet analyses.

## Setup

Most of the notebooks here can be run in [SWAN](https://swan.web.cern.ch/swan/) with AlmaLinux9 and LCG stack 105a. If you want to run the notebooks for example in VSCode, or you would like to just take the code part and run them as scripts, you can setup the LCG stack on EL9 lxplus machines (the default at the time of writing) with the following command:

`source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_105a/x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt/setup.sh`
